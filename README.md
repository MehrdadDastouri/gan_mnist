# Generative Adversarial Network for MNIST

This project implements a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in PyTorch to generate handwritten digits similar to the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- **Generator**: A neural network that generates fake images from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: A neural network that distinguishes between real and fake images.
- **Training Process**: Both networks are trained adversarially to improve over time.
